# Listopia babylist

Listopia is my baby wishlist in a web application. It allows guests to book gifts for our baby and to get redirected to the vendor's website.

Feel free to participate if you feel like it !

## Deployment

The Listopia project has been deployed on Vercel:

[listopia-omega.vercel.app](https://listopia-omega.vercel.app/)

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Next, Redux, MaterialUI, Resend

**Server:** Node, Express, Mongoose

**Database:** MongoDB

## Frontend

The application's frontend is available on my Github as well [here](https://github.com/michaelrasolo/listopia-frontend).

The frontend uses the backend as an API to perform persistent actions on the MongoDB database.
